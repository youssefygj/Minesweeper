# Minesweeper
AI Module for Minesweeper Robot in Haskell

This project involved implementing an AI module for a minesweeper robot using Haskell, a functional programming language. The robot operates in a 4 Ã— 4 grid of cells, where each cell can be empty, contain the robot, or contain a mine. The robot can move in all four directions and collect a mine if it is in the same cell as the mine. The AI module takes as input the initial position of the robot and the positions of all of the mines, and computes a sequence of actions that the robot can follow to collect all the mines. The project demonstrates the use of recursion, pattern matching, and higher-order functions in Haskell to solve a complex problem.
